# Grid
The idiot man's idiot project.

## No but seriously
I've been thinking about Conway's Game of Life, and this is some tinkering sort of in that direction. I'm trying to write a session-aware game of life where user input exists through out the session, and with a more complex gamespace in a sense, i.e. a more complex possible realm of combinations for cells to interact with each other. The "life" part, the part where the cells toggle between alive and dead are still 2D, but the rest of the system is more complex. The cells' interactions are essentially the shadows inside the proverbial Plato's cave, while the objects causing the shadows are grid components. There's a hashing-y reference here, in the way that in an ideal world the cell interaction combos themselves would have to be unique when considered as a sequence over a certain period of time varying based upon the grid component behaviour.

But this is too much for now so I'll stop. Maybe more tomorrow if I get some coding done.
